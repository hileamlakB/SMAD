In this assignment, you and your partner will build a model of a small, asynchronous distributed system. It will run on a single machine, but you will model multiple machines running at different speeds. And you will build a logical clock for each of the model machines.

Each model machine will run at a clock rate determined during initialization. You will pick a random number between 1 and 6, and that will be the number of clock ticks per (real world) second for that machine. This means that only that many instructions can be performed by the machine during that time. Each machine will also have a network queue (which is not constrained to the n operations per second) in which it will hold incoming messages. The (virtual) machine should listen on one or more sockets for such messages.

Each of your virtual machines should connect to each of the other virtual machines so that messages can be passed between them. Doing this is part of initialization, and not constrained to happen at the speed of the internal model clocks. Each virtual machine should also open a file as a log. Finally, each machine should have a logical clock, which should be updated using the rules for logical clocks.

Once initialization is complete, each virtual machine should work according to the following specification:

On each clock cycle, if there is a message in the message queue for the machine (remember, the queue is not running at the same cycle speed) the virtual machine should take one message off the queue, update the local logical clock, and write in the log that it received a message, the global time (gotten from the system), the length of the message queue, and the logical clock time.

If there is no message in the queue, the virtual machine should generate a random number in the range of 1-10, and

- if the value is 1, send to one of the other machines a message that is the local logical clock time, update it’s own logical clock, and update the log with the send, the system time, and the logical clock time
- if the value is 2, send to the other virtual machine a message that is the local logical clock time, update it’s own logical clock, and update the log with the send, the system time, and the logical clock time.
- if the value is 3, send to both of the other virtual machines a message that is the logical clock time, update it’s own logical clock, and update the log with the send, the system time, and the logical clock time.
- if the value is other than 1-3, treat the cycle as an internal event; update the local logical clock, and log the internal event, the system time, and the logical clock value.

While working on this, keep a lab notebook in which you note the design decisions you have made. Then, run the scale model at least 5 times for at least one minute each time. Examine the logs, and discuss (in the lab book) the size of the jumps in the values for the logical clocks, drift in the values of the local logical clocks in the different machines (you can get a god’s eye view because of the system time), and the impact different timings on such things as gaps in the logical clock values and length of the message queue. Observations and reflections about the model and the results of running the model are more than welcome.

Once you have run this on three virtual machines that can vary their internal times by an order of magnitude, try running it with a smaller variation in the clock cycles and a smaller probability of the event being internal. What differences do those variations make? Add these observations to your lab notebook. Play around, and see if you can find something interesting.

You may use whatever packages or support code for the construction of the model machines and for the communication between the processes.

You will turn in both the code (or a pointer to your repo containing the code) and the lab notebook. You will also demo this, presenting your code and choices, during demo day 2.
